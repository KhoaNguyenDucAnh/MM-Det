## Diffusion Video Forensics Dataset

### Full Version
We release Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) as the benchmark for forgery video detection. 

The full version of DVF can be downloaded via links: [BaiduNetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/14d-_jLB_yUwKzOosrMHMvg?pwd=296c)(Code: 296c). [google driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NxCvJVPSxV2Mib5NaNj5Cf2WnnjrqpMb?usp=drive_link)


### Tiny Version

We also release a tiny version of DVF for quickstart, in which each dataset contains 10 videos, with each video no more than 100 frames. This tiny version can be downloaded via [BaiduNetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FeI9OH_7rqTaTd-ldPCAIg?pwd=77x3) (Code:77x3). We also provide the corresponding reconsturction dataset and MM representations for evaluation in the above link. More information for evaluation can be found at [here](#evaluation).

## Preparation

### Pre-trained Weights
We provide the [weights](https://huggingface.co/sparklexfantasy/llava-7b-1.5-rfrd) for our fine-tuned large multi-modal model, which is based on llava-v1.5-Vicuna-7b from [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). The overall weights for MM-Det without the LMM can be obtained via [weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RRNS8F7ETZWrcBu8fvB3pM9qHbmSEEzy?usp=sharing) at `MM-Det/current_model.pth`. Please download and put the weights at `./weights/`.

### Reconstruction Dataset

For the full version of DVF, we provide a ready reconstruction dataset at [BaiduNetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a0sWzGXfkBfblV1wZ70qsQ?pwd=l8h4) (Code: l8h4).

### Multi-Modal Forgery Representation

For the full version of DVF, we provide a ready dataset for cached MMFR at [BaiduNetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kuybGikCfxs8CnTnxWI-gQ?pwd=m6uy) (Code: m6uy). Since the representation is fixed during training and inference, it is recommended to cache the representation before the overall training to reduce time cost. 

## Evaluation


### Data Structure
For evaluation on the tiny version of DVF, put all files of [the tiny version](#tiny-version) into `./data`. The data structure is organized as follows:

```
-- data
  | -- DVF_tiny
  | -- DVF_recons_tiny    # $RECONSTRUCTION_DATASET_ROOT
  | -- mm_representations_tiny  # $MM_REPRESENTATION_ROOT
```

For evaluation on the full version of DVF, download the data at [Reconstruction Dataset](#reconstruction-dataset) and [Multi-Modal Forgery Representation](#multi-modal-forgery-representation). Then put them into `./data`. The data structure is organized as follows:

```
-- data
  | -- DVF
  | -- DVF_recons   # $RECONSTRUCTION_DATASET_ROOT
  | -- mm_representations  # $MM_REPRESENTATION_ROOT
```

For evaluation on customized dataset, details of data preparation can be found at [dataset/readme.md](dataset/readme.md).

### Inference
Make sure the pre-trained weights are organized at `./weights`. Please set `$RECONSTRUCTION_DATASET_ROOT` and `$MM_REPRESENTATION_ROOT` as the data roots provided at [Data Structure](#data-structure) in `launch-test.sh`. `--cache-mm` is recommended for save the computational and memory cost of LMM branch. Then run `launch-test.sh` for testing on 7 datasets respectively.

```bash
python test.py \
--classes videocrafter1 zeroscope opensora sora pika stablediffusion stablevideo \
--ckpt ./weights/MM-Det/current_model.pth \
--data-root $RECONSTRUCTION_DATASET_ROOT \
--cache-mm \
--mm-root $MM_REPRESENTATION_ROOT\
# when sample-size > 0, only [sample-size] videos are evaluated for each dataset for pattial evaluation.
--sample-size -1
```

Since the entire evaluation is time-costing, `sample-size` can be specified (e.g., 1,000) to reduce time by conducting inference only on limited (1,000) videos. To finish the entire evaluation, please set `sample-size` as `-1`.


## Training

### LMM Fine-tuning (Not necessary)
Our LMM branch is built upon [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA), with [llava-v1.5-Vicuna-7b](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b) set as the base model. Our fine-tuned LMM weights can be achieved [here](https://huggingface.co/sparklexfantasy/llava-7b-1.5-rfrd)(#pretrained-weights). It is recommended to start the overall training directly using our pretrained LMM weights, otherwise the fine-tuning result may not be steady.

We directly conduct the visual instruction tuning stage in [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA#train) on a gemini-generated instruction dataset [RFRD](placeholder). For more information on customized LMM fine-tuning, please refer to [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA).

### Overall Training

#### Preliminary Setup
Our ST backbone is based on Hybrid-ViT at [pytorch-image-models](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models). Our model is based on `vit_base_resnet50_224_in21k`. To start training from a pretrained model, you can get the pretrained weights at [pytorch-image-models](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models). We also provide a direct [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RRNS8F7ETZWrcBu8fvB3pM9qHbmSEEzy?usp=sharing) at `ViT/vit_base_r50_s16_224.orig_in21k`. Please put downloaded weights at `./weights/`.

#### Training
Run the following scripts `launch-train.bash` for an overall training on our model. It is recommended to first cache Multi-Modal Forgery Representations at `$MM_REPRESENTATION_ROOT`. In this case, `--cache-mm` is specified, and LMM branch will not be loaded to save huge computational costs and memory usage. 

```bash
python train.py \
--data-root $RECONSTRUCTION_DATASET_ROOT \
--classes youtube stablevideodiffusion \
--cache-mm \
--mm-root $MM_REPRESENTATION_ROOT \
--expt $EXPT_NAME \
```
